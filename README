ftag -- tag and filter your files
=================================

ftag is a command line tool to tag files. It is currently
in a very early state of development, and supports three
modes of operation: tagging, filtering, and listing. All
contribution yields a personal hug from jacwah.

ftag file FILE TAG...
Add any number of tags to the file FILE.

ftag filter TAG...
Print all files tagged with one or more of the given tags
to stdout.

ftag list FILE
Print all tags associated with the file FILE on stdout.

ftag --help
Display additional help.

make
Compile.

make clean
Remove everything created by make.

.ftagdb
The SQLite3 database file ftag uses to save tags. On
startup ftag ascends from the current dir to / looking for
this file. If it's not found it is created in the current
directory.

echo 'Jacob Wahlgren jacob.wahlgren@gmail.com jacwah/ftag'
Print the name and email address of the original author and
the github repo to stdout.
