ftag -- tag and filter your files
=================================

ftag is a command line tool to tag files. Muliple tags can be
attached to the same file name. Files can later be filtered by tags.
You should not expect to much of this small project as of yet, but
are welcome to contribute. Below is a short description of the three
modes available and their use. A more complete reference can be found
using the --help option. Run 'make' to compile the sources. I can be
reached in the github repo at github.com/jacwah/ftag. Unix-like
systems, like OSX and Linux are supported.

ftag file FILE TAG...
Add any number of tags to the file FILE.

ftag filter TAG...
Print all files tagged with one or more of the given tags to stdout.

ftag list FILE
Print all tags associated with the file FILE on stdout.

.ftagdb
This is the SQLite database file ftag uses to save tags. On startup
ftag ascends from the current dir to / looking for this file. If it's
not found it is created in the current directory.
